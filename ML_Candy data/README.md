## INTRODUCTION
_This dataset is Copyright (c) 2014 ESPN Internet Ventures and distributed under an MIT license. Thanks to Walt Hickey for making the data available_.

_As we can see, we’re working with quite a small dataset here that contains certain attributes about the candies included in the internet based survey. Let’s now have a peek at some descriptive statistics_.
